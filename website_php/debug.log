sample friendly letter to a
friend asking for a favour

p)

‘As you know, my truck hos been acting up quite a bit
recently, | took it to the mechanic, and he said that it

is in dire need of a tune-up; however, it will cost almost
$400 to get all of the work done. He soid thot if | had

4 friend who was knowledgeable about i, it would probably
‘be worth buying the parts myself and having them help.

Dear George,

So, 'm writing because | know that you are very handy
‘and enjoy tinkering with cars. Would you be willing to let
‘me borrow your tools ond help me get my truck tuned up?
It would realy help me out and save me a good amount

of money. ary
